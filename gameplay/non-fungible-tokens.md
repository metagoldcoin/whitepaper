# Non-Fungible Tokens

### Currently there will be 2 types

1. World Class NFTs - Can only be owned in a particular world with Characters
2. MGC's VU NFTs - Universally recognisable 3D models & Characters

### World Class NFTs

Every Structure and Character added to world except land can be owned & purchased by the players and investors with our future marketplace.

The 3 Worlds that are mentioned in the docs will be the first to benefit from it with our already implemented structures and characters. Additionaly players & artist will be able to mint their own NFTs in the game wheather it is a structure or charater it is permittable.

### MGC's VU NFTs

These NFTs will be the main art that will give $MGC Token's exchange capabilities All around the VU. That can be purchased, rented out or modified with owners accessability. These NFTs can be only minted by the Core Team of Meta Gold Coin
